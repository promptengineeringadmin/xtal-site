## Pricing Page (/pricing)

Content source: pricing.json

Key implementation notes:
- Interactive cost calculator: input field for monthly searches, real-time calculation display
- Pricing cards: Growth (highlighted) and Enterprise side-by-side
- ROI calculator section with before/after scenario
- Competitor comparison table (don't use their logos—just names)
- FAQ accordion with schema markup for SEO
- Trust badges at bottom CTA (no credit card, cancel anytime, no setup fees)

Design notes:
- Growth plan card should have visual emphasis (border, subtle background, "Most Popular" badge)
- Calculator should feel interactive but simple—not a complex configurator
- Keep the ROI math visible but not overwhelming; it's supporting evidence, not the headline
