# Competitor & Alternative Pages

## XTAL Context — CRITICAL
**Before creating ANY competitor content, you MUST read `.claude/commands/xtal-business.md`.** It is the single source of truth for:
- Verified competitor pricing (Algolia tiers, Doofinder plans, Athos/Klevu/Searchspring merger status)
- Where XTAL wins vs each competitor (and where they win)
- Content guidelines (verify pricing, no fabrication, qualified claims in comparison tables)

**XTAL is**: AI-native ecommerce search for mid-market teams ($5M–$100M revenue).

**Existing comparison content** (in `content/blog/`):
- `algolia-alternatives-for-ecommerce.mdx`
- `klevu-vs-algolia-vs-xtal.mdx`
- `xtal-vs-searchspring.mdx`
- `improve-shopify-search-without-developer.mdx`

**Competitors** (see xtal-business.md for full details):
- **Primary**: Algolia (NeuralSearch gated at $20K+/yr Elevate tier)
- **Merged**: Klevu + Searchspring → Athos Commerce (Jan 2025)
- **Budget**: Doofinder ($49–$349/mo), Searchanise (not serious at mid-market)

**Key content rules**:
- All competitor pricing MUST come from xtal-business.md or be re-verified against their current website
- Never fabricate case studies or customer quotes
- Comparison tables must use qualified values like "AI-guided via prompts" not bare checkmarks for merchandising
- Acknowledge competitor strengths honestly — this builds trust
- Algolia Grow ($0.50/1K) ≠ Grow Plus ($1.75/1K) — always distinguish tiers correctly

   - Conversion from competitor users
   - Brand positioning

## Page Formats

### Format 1: [Competitor] Alternative (Singular)

**Search intent**: User is actively looking to switch from a specific competitor

**URL pattern**: `/alternatives/[competitor]` or `/[competitor]-alternative`

**Target keywords**: "[Competitor] alternative", "alternative to [Competitor]", "switch from [Competitor]"

**Page structure**:
1. Why people look for alternatives (validate their pain)
2. Summary: You as the alternative (quick positioning)
3. Detailed comparison (features, service, pricing)
4. Who should switch (and who shouldn't)
5. Migration path
6. Social proof from switchers
7. CTA

---

### Format 2: [Competitor] Alternatives (Plural)

**Search intent**: User is researching options, earlier in journey

**URL pattern**: `/alternatives/[competitor]-alternatives`

**Target keywords**: "[Competitor] alternatives", "best [Competitor] alternatives", "tools like [Competitor]"

**Page structure**:
1. Why people look for alternatives (common pain points)
2. What to look for in an alternative (criteria framework)
3. List of alternatives (you first, but include real options)
4. Comparison table (summary)
5. Detailed breakdown of each alternative
6. Recommendation by use case
7. CTA

**Important**: Include 4-7 real alternatives. Being genuinely helpful builds trust and ranks better.

---

### Format 3: You vs [Competitor]

**Search intent**: User is directly comparing you to a specific competitor

**URL pattern**: `/vs/[competitor]` or `/compare/[you]-vs-[competitor]`

**Target keywords**: "[You] vs [Competitor]", "[Competitor] vs [You]"

**Page structure**:
1. TL;DR summary (key differences in 2-3 sentences)
2. At-a-glance comparison table
3. Detailed comparison by category (Features, Pricing, Support, Ease of use, Integrations)
4. Who XTAL is best for
5. Who [Competitor] is best for (be honest)
6. What customers say (testimonials from switchers — do NOT fabricate)
7. Migration support
8. CTA

---

### Format 4: [Competitor A] vs [Competitor B]

**Search intent**: User comparing two competitors (not you directly)

**URL pattern**: `/compare/[competitor-a]-vs-[competitor-b]`

**Page structure**:
1. Overview of both products
2. Comparison by category
3. Who each is best for
4. The third option (introduce XTAL)
5. Comparison table (all three)
6. CTA

**Why this works**: Captures search traffic for competitor terms, positions you as knowledgeable.

## Essential Sections

### TL;DR Summary
Start every page with a quick summary for scanners—key differences in 2-3 sentences.

### Paragraph Comparisons
Go beyond tables. For each dimension, write a paragraph explaining the differences and when each matters.

### Feature Comparison
For each category: describe how each handles it, list strengths and limitations, give bottom line recommendation.

### Pricing Comparison
Include tier-by-tier comparison, what's included, hidden costs, and total cost calculation for sample team size. **All pricing must be sourced from xtal-business.md or verified against the competitor's current website before publishing.**

### Who It's For
Be explicit about ideal customer for each option. Honest recommendations build trust.

### Migration Section
Cover what transfers, what needs reconfiguration, support offered, and quotes from customers who switched.

---

## Content Architecture

### Centralized Competitor Data
Create a single source of truth for each competitor with:
- Positioning and target audience
- Pricing (all tiers)
- Feature ratings
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Best for / not ideal for
- Common complaints (from reviews)
- Migration notes

The canonical source for XTAL's competitive intelligence is `.claude/commands/xtal-business.md`. When creating a new competitor data file, pull verified figures from there first.

## Research Process

### Deep Competitor Research

For each competitor, gather:

1. **Product research**: Sign up, use it, document features/UX/limitations
2. **Pricing research**: Current pricing, what's included, hidden costs
3. **Review mining**: G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for common praise/complaint themes
4. **Customer feedback**: Talk to customers who switched (both directions)
5. **Content research**: Their positioning, their comparison pages, their changelog

### Ongoing Updates

- **Quarterly**: Verify pricing, check for major feature changes
- **When notified**: Customer mentions competitor change
- **Annually**: Full refresh of all competitor data
