  - question: "Is Doofinder cheaper than XTAL?"
    answer: "Doofinder starts at $49/month ($44/month billed annually) for small stores, making it one of the most affordable search solutions available. XTAL's pricing is higher but includes AI-native features — LLM-based query understanding, dynamic aspects, and marketing re-ranking — that Doofinder doesn't offer."
  - question: "When should I upgrade from Doofinder to XTAL?"
    answer: "Consider upgrading when your store gets significant natural language or problem-based queries that Doofinder's synonym management can't fully resolve, when you're seeing persistent zero-result or low-relevance rates on long-tail searches, or when you want AI-powered result quality without managing synonym dictionaries and manual rules."
  - question: "Does Doofinder have AI search?"
    answer: "Doofinder offers basic NLP, autocomplete, and some machine learning for result ranking. It doesn't use the same LLM-based approach as XTAL. Doofinder's strength is providing solid, affordable search with good synonym management and easy visual merchandising without requiring AI sophistication."
  - question: "Which is better for European stores?"
    answer: "Doofinder is headquartered in Spain and has strong European presence with GDPR-compliant infrastructure and support for 30+ languages with built-in stemming. XTAL also supports European stores and its LLM handles multilingual queries naturally, but Doofinder has more explicit language-specific optimizations for European markets."
  - question: "Can I migrate from Doofinder to XTAL easily?"
    answer: "Yes. XTAL indexes directly from your ecommerce platform, so switching from Doofinder is straightforward — remove the Doofinder script, add the XTAL snippet. Most stores complete the switch in under an hour."
  - question: "Does XTAL support the same languages as Doofinder?"
    answer: "Doofinder supports 30+ languages with built-in stemming and translation features reflecting its multilingual European heritage. XTAL's LLM-based approach handles multiple languages naturally through its language model foundation, but may have fewer explicit language-specific tuning options for less common European languages."

Doofinder occupies a specific, well-defined position in the ecommerce search market: it's the accessible, fast-to-deploy option for stores that need meaningful search improvement without a large budget or a dedicated engineering team. With a 4.7/5 rating across nearly 500 G2 reviews and pricing that starts at $49/month, it's earned that position legitimately.

This comparison isn't about dismissing that value. If you're a small store with a tight budget and basic search needs, Doofinder may be the right call today. This page is about helping you understand where Doofinder's ceiling is, what XTAL does differently, and whether the AI gap matters for your specific store.

## TL;DR

- Doofinder starts at **$49/month** ($44/month billed annually) — one of the more affordable search tools available, with a free trial. For small stores, that value is genuine.
- Doofinder's AI layer is **basic NLP and autocomplete**, not LLM-based reasoning. It handles common queries well; long-tail and natural language queries are where gaps appear.
- XTAL uses **LLM-based query understanding** — intent, context, and brand vocabulary baked into every search, not configured manually via synonyms.
- The typical **upgrade trigger**: high zero-result rates on unusual queries, shoppers searching by problem or use case rather than product name, or outgrowing synonym-dictionary management.

## Pricing Comparison

**Doofinder** has the most accessible pricing structure in its tier:

- **Basic**: $49/month ($44/month billed annually) — up to 10K requests/month, AI search, recommendations
- **Pro**: $149/month ($134/month billed annually) — up to 150K requests/month
- **Advanced**: $349/month ($314/month billed annually) — up to 400K requests/month, 1:1 personalization, visual search
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing

It's worth noting that Doofinder's pricing historically scales with search request volume at higher tiers, and some users report that pricing can climb for stores with significant traffic. The 30-day free trial with no credit card is a genuine differentiator for testing before committing.

**XTAL Search** pricing is usage-based. [Contact us](/contact) for a quote. The starting price point is higher than Doofinder's Basic tier, but the AI capabilities included at baseline — LLM query understanding, dynamic aspects, marketing re-ranking — are features that don't exist in Doofinder's lineup at any tier.

If budget is the primary decision criterion and your catalog is small with relatively straightforward queries, Doofinder's lower price floor is a real advantage. If search quality on complex queries matters and you're comfortable with a higher monthly number, XTAL's value proposition shifts.

## Setup Complexity

**Doofinder** is genuinely easy to set up — this is one of its most frequently praised attributes. Users consistently report going from signup to live search in 30 minutes or less. The Shopify app installs directly. The visual merchandising interface is drag-and-drop. The analytics dashboard is approachable for non-technical users. For a solo operator or a small team without a developer, Doofinder's onboarding experience is one of the best in the market.

The caveat: users also report that getting the most out of Doofinder — managing synonyms well, configuring redirects, setting up product feeds correctly for recommendations — has a higher learning curve than the initial setup suggests. Once you're past basic deployment and trying to tune relevance for specific query patterns, you're into configuration work.

**XTAL Search** deploys as a `<script>` tag. Add one line to your storefront header, and the overlay intercepts your existing search input. No Shopify theme modifications. No plugin install with complex settings panels. No synonym dictionaries to build. The embeddable snippet model means there's essentially nothing to configure for initial deployment.

Where XTAL's setup requires more thought: prompt tuning. The brand and marketing prompts that guide XTAL's LLM are how you customize search behavior — and crafting prompts that reflect your catalog's vocabulary takes some iteration. That's a different kind of configuration work than Doofinder's synonym management, but it's not none.

## AI Capabilities

This is the clearest difference between the two platforms, and it's worth being specific about what each actually does.

**Doofinder's AI layer** handles the things you'd expect from a solid mid-tier search solution: typo tolerance, autocomplete suggestions based on query patterns, basic NLP that matches symptom-based or problem-based queries to product categories, and some machine learning for result ranking using behavioral signals. It also offers voice search and visual/image search — areas where XTAL currently does not have coverage.

Where Doofinder's AI shows its limits: on long-tail or unusual queries, it relies on synonyms and redirect rules you've configured. A shopper typing "something to help me sleep better" will find products if you've added "sleep" as a synonym to your category and your product descriptions use that language. But it won't reason about what "help me sleep better" actually means in the context of your catalog and return the best available products without that configuration.

**XTAL's AI layer** starts with a large language model. Before retrieval, the query is understood semantically — what is the shopper actually trying to accomplish? The LLM is given context about your brand and catalog vocabulary, so it can interpret "help me sleep better" without you pre-configuring every variant of sleep-related language. After retrieval, a second LLM pass re-ranks results through a marketing lens — surface things that are in stock, that align with your brand priorities, that convert.

This means XTAL handles zero-result scenarios differently. Instead of failing on a query you haven't anticipated, it reasons about intent and surfaces the best available approximation. For stores with diverse, conversational shoppers — particularly in health, wellness, beauty, cannabis, or specialty retail — this distinction matters significantly.

<Callout type="insight">
  Doofinder's G2 reviews highlight two consistent limitations: search results degrade on queries phrased in ways the synonym configuration doesn't anticipate, and analytics feel surface-level for teams trying to understand *why* results ranked as they did. Both are structural characteristics of a keyword-plus-ML architecture, not fixable with better configuration.

## Who Should Choose Which

**Doofinder is the stronger choice if:**

- You're a small store (under 10,000 SKUs, tight budget) and $49–$349/month represents the right price range for what you need
- Your shoppers search by product name and category — straightforward queries where keyword matching and typo tolerance cover the use cases
- You want voice or image search capabilities, which Doofinder supports and XTAL currently does not
- You're a European store where GDPR compliance, multilingual stemming for specific regional languages, and Spanish-language support matter
- You want a free trial before committing — Doofinder's 30-day trial with no credit card is a genuine no-risk evaluation path
- Your team is non-technical and needs a drag-and-drop merchandising interface to manage product placement visually

**XTAL Search is the stronger choice if:**

- Your shoppers use natural language, problem-based, or use-case queries: "what should I use for X," "something that works for Y" — queries that keyword matching struggles with even with good synonym management
- You're experiencing high zero-result rates that synonym rules aren't fully resolving
- You're in health, wellness, beauty, cannabis, specialty food, or any vertical where product discovery depends on understanding intent rather than product names
- You want search relevance that improves through AI prompt tuning rather than manual synonym and redirect maintenance
- You're on a custom or headless storefront where an embeddable snippet is a cleaner fit than a platform plugin
- Your store is growing and you're thinking about what search needs to look like at 2x current catalog size — AI-native search tends to scale better than rules-based search as catalog complexity grows

The honest framing: Doofinder is a good product for what it does. It's not trying to be XTAL, and XTAL isn't trying to be Doofinder's low-price alternative. The choice is mostly about where your store is on the complexity curve.

## FAQ

### Is Doofinder cheaper than XTAL?

Yes, significantly at the entry tier. Doofinder starts at $49/month ($44/month billed annually) — one of the more affordable entry points in the market. XTAL's pricing is higher but includes AI-native features that Doofinder doesn't offer at any tier. [Contact us](/contact) for XTAL pricing specific to your catalog size.

### When should I upgrade from Doofinder to XTAL?

The clearest upgrade signals: your zero-result rate isn't improving despite adding synonyms, shoppers are typing natural language or problem-based queries that your current search can't interpret, or you're spending significant time maintaining synonym dictionaries and redirect rules that keep breaking as your catalog evolves. Those are signs you've hit Doofinder's ceiling.

### Does Doofinder have AI search?

Doofinder offers basic NLP, autocomplete with ML-powered suggestions, and some behavioral ranking ML. It's meaningfully better than purely keyword search. It's not LLM-based — it doesn't reason about intent; it pattern-matches against learned or configured language. For straightforward catalogs and query patterns, that's often sufficient. For complex, conversational search behavior, it's not.

### Which is better for European stores?

Doofinder has a structural advantage here: it's Spain-headquartered, GDPR-compliant infrastructure, supports 30+ languages with built-in stemming, and has a strong European customer base. XTAL supports European stores and handles multilingual queries naturally through its LLM, but Doofinder has more explicit language infrastructure for European regional languages. For stores where EU data residency is a strict compliance requirement, verify hosting specifics with both providers.

### Can I migrate from Doofinder to XTAL easily?

Yes. XTAL indexes from your ecommerce platform directly, so migrating isn't a Doofinder export problem — it's just switching the script tag. Remove the Doofinder snippet, add the XTAL snippet, configure your brand prompt. Most stores complete the switch in under an hour.

### Does XTAL support the same languages as Doofinder?

Doofinder explicitly supports 30+ languages with language-specific stemming, making it strong for multilingual European catalogs. XTAL's LLM handles multiple languages through its underlying language model, which is natively multilingual, but without dedicated per-language stemming tuning. For stores where 10+ European languages need to work well out of the box, Doofinder's language infrastructure is more explicitly built for that.
