Ecommerce search is one of the highest-ROI features on any online store. Shoppers who use the search bar convert at up to 3x the rate of those who browse without it. They spend more per order. They come back more often. Yet for most stores, search remains almost entirely unaudited — a feature that was turned on once and never meaningfully evaluated since.

We wanted to know: **what does the aggregate data say about the actual quality of ecommerce search in the wild?**

So we analyzed hundreds of ecommerce stores using XTAL's [Site Search Grader](/grade) — a tool that evaluates stores across eight dimensions of search quality and produces a composite 0–100 score. What we found was worse than we expected, in ways that were more specific and actionable than the usual hand-waving about "bad search experiences."

This article presents the key findings. If you want the full methodology behind how we score stores, see [What Is a Good Ecommerce Search Score?](/blog/what-is-a-good-ecommerce-search-score). For guidance on what to do about any of this, see our [ecommerce site search best practices guide](/blog/ecommerce-site-search-best-practices).

## Methodology (Brief)

Our analysis evaluated ecommerce stores using an automated grading pipeline that simulates real shopper queries — natural language searches, typo-laden queries, zero-result edge cases, and intent-driven phrases — and scores results across eight dimensions: relevance, natural language understanding (NLP), zero-result handling, typo tolerance, facet and filter quality, results diversity, speed, and mobile experience.

Scores are weighted and rolled up to a 0–100 composite, which maps to letter grades: A (80+), B (60–79), C (40–59), D (20–39), F (below 20).

The stores in this analysis range from small independent retailers to mid-market brands, spanning Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, and custom-built storefronts. For a complete explanation of the scoring methodology and what each dimension measures, see the [methodology article](/blog/what-is-a-good-ecommerce-search-score).

## Key Finding: The Average Ecommerce Search Score Is 38 Out of 100

**The average composite search quality score across stores we analyzed was 38 out of 100 — a solid D.**

That's not "room for improvement." That's a failing grade. It means the median ecommerce store has search that is actively damaging the shopper experience, not just failing to optimize it.

</Callout>

If you've ever tried searching for something on a mid-sized online store and felt the search return garbage results, now you know why: most stores haven't audited their search in years — or ever. The search bar is a box that was turned on during platform setup and has been quietly losing sales ever since.

### Grade Distribution: More Fs Than As by a Factor of Six

Here is how stores broke down across the grade spectrum:

| Grade | Score Range | Share of Stores |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **A** | 80–100 | **4%** |
| **B** | 60–79 | 11% |
| **C** | 40–59 | 23% |
| **D** | 20–39 | 34% |
| **F** | Below 20 | 28% |

**62% of stores scored below 40** — meaning nearly two-thirds fell into the D or F range. Only 15% of stores achieved a B or higher. A-grade stores are genuinely rare: one in twenty-five.

## Most Common Failure Dimensions

Not all eight dimensions fail equally. Some are close to universally broken. Others reveal a sharp divide between stores that have invested in modern search infrastructure and those still running on default configurations.

### 1. NLP: The Near-Universal Failure (67% Score Zero)

**67% of stores scored a zero on the NLP dimension.** Not low — zero. These stores' search engines have no capacity to parse intent, understand synonyms, or interpret a query that isn't a verbatim product title or SKU.

This is the single starkest finding in the data. Natural language understanding is what separates a search experience that feels like a tool from one that feels like a guessing game. When a shopper types "cozy gift for a reader" and gets zero results — or worse, completely unrelated products — they don't give the store a second chance. They leave.

<Callout type="insight">
**67% of stores scored a zero on NLP** — the dimension that determines whether search understands what shoppers actually mean. Legacy keyword matching is the culprit in nearly every case.
</Callout>

### 2. Zero-Result Handling: Failing at the Most Critical Moment

**71% of stores showed a blank or unhelpful page** when queries returned no results. No suggestions. No alternative categories. No "did you mean?" prompt. Just a dead end.

This matters enormously because zero-result scenarios are precisely when shoppers are most vulnerable to abandoning. Research from multiple industry sources consistently shows that around 80% of shoppers who encounter a failed search will leave the site entirely and buy elsewhere. Yet nearly three-quarters of stores have done nothing to catch that fall.

### 3. Typo Tolerance: Basic Expectation, Routinely Ignored

**58% of stores failed to return any relevant results** for queries with common misspellings — "shampo," "cofee maker," "runing shoes." These aren't obscure typos. They're the natural byproduct of mobile keyboards and fast typing, and they represent a meaningful percentage of real queries on any site.

A search engine that punishes shoppers for being human isn't a product feature. It's a liability.

### 4. Mobile Search Experience: Desktop UIs Shipped Untested

**54% of stores had meaningful mobile-specific defects** — filters that required horizontal scrolling, tap targets too small for fingertips, or search result pages that re-rendered the full page on every filter selection. These are problems that simply don't appear in a desktop audit, which is why they persist.

### 5. Results Diversity: The Duplicate Trap

**49% of stores returned results that were dominated by near-identical products** for broad queries. A search for "blue jacket" showing twelve nearly-identical blue puffer jackets is not diversity — it's an over-indexed retrieval model presenting one product cluster as if it represented the full catalog.

---

## Breakdown by Platform

Platform choice is one of the most reliable predictors of search quality — not because platforms differ dramatically in intent, but because their default search configurations differ enormously in capability.

### Shopify

Average score: **41/100**

Shopify stores skewed toward the C–D range. Shopify's default search (Shopify Search & Discovery) handles typo tolerance reasonably well and has improved in recent years, but it scores consistently at or near zero on NLP. Stores running the default search configuration without a third-party search app almost universally land below 50.

The Shopify stores that scored in the B range had one thing in common: they had replaced the default search with a third-party provider. That swap alone typically added 20–30 points to the composite score.

### WooCommerce

Average score: **29/100**

WooCommerce stores had the lowest average score of any platform. WooCommerce's native search is WordPress search with product post types — essentially a keyword-matching system with no search-specific tuning. It's not designed for product discovery. Most WooCommerce stores running default search scored F or low D on NLP, zero-result handling, and diversity.

The gap between WooCommerce stores running default search and those with a proper search layer is the largest we observed on any platform.

### BigCommerce

Average score: **47/100**

BigCommerce stores performed somewhat better than the median, largely because BigCommerce's native search has better baseline relevance and some degree of synonym handling built in. The platform's stores still clustered in the C range on average, with NLP remaining the primary gap.

### Custom / Headless

Average score: **61/100**

Custom-built storefronts — brands running headless architectures with a dedicated search provider like Elasticsearch, Typesense, or an AI search layer — showed significantly higher scores. The tradeoff is cost and complexity. These are almost exclusively larger brands with engineering resources allocated specifically to search.

The custom/headless group also showed the widest variance: the highest-scoring stores overall were in this category, as were some surprisingly poor performers — stores where a custom build went unmaintained after launch.

<Callout type="insight">
**WooCommerce stores averaged 29/100** — the lowest of any platform — while custom headless storefronts averaged **61/100**. Default platform search is the biggest single factor dragging scores down.
</Callout>

---

## Breakdown by Store Size

Store size — measured by approximate catalog size and traffic tier — also correlated with search quality, though less strongly than platform.

### Small Stores (Under 500 SKUs)

Average score: **33/100**

Small stores showed the lowest average scores. This is partly because small stores are less likely to have dedicated engineering resources for search optimization, and partly because the economics don't obviously justify investing in a search layer when you only have 200 products. The counterintuitive reality: small catalogs can actually be harder to search well, because there are fewer fallback products to surface when a query partially matches.

### Medium Stores (500–5,000 SKUs)

Average score: **39/100**

Medium stores clustered tightly around the overall average. These are the stores where bad search hurts the most in absolute revenue terms — large enough that search is a meaningful discovery channel, not yet large enough that most operators have treated search as a strategic investment.

### Large Stores (5,000+ SKUs)

Average score: **52/100**

Large stores scored meaningfully higher on average, primarily because a larger catalog creates more pressure to invest in search infrastructure — shoppers simply can't find anything without it, so the business case for improvement becomes undeniable. That said, large stores still frequently scored zero on NLP: a catalog of 50,000 SKUs powered by keyword matching is only marginally better than a catalog of 500 powered by the same technology.

## The NLP Gap: Why 67% of Stores Are Still Running on 2010 Technology

The NLP finding deserves its own section because it is the single most consequential data point in this study — and the one with the most direct fix.

**Natural language understanding is a hard binary in practice.** Either a store's search engine can interpret shopper intent from natural language, or it cannot. There is almost no middle ground in the data: stores either scored near-zero on NLP, or they scored in the 70–90 range. We rarely saw a score of 30 or 45.

This bimodal distribution tells you something important: NLP is not a feature that improves incrementally with configuration tweaks. It is a capability that exists or doesn't, based on the underlying search technology. Legacy keyword matching — which is what Shopify's default search, WooCommerce's search, and most basic search implementations use — physically cannot understand intent. It matches tokens. A query for "comfortable chair for long hours at a desk" against a keyword search engine will match products containing those words, not products that are ergonomic office chairs.

### What NLP Actually Unlocks

With NLP, a query like "something waterproof for hiking in Scotland in October" can surface appropriate rain gear, boot covers, and pack covers — even if none of those products have "October" or "Scotland" in their descriptions. The search engine understands the intent (waterproof outdoor gear for cold, wet conditions) and retrieves accordingly.

Without NLP, the same query returns either nothing, or products that happen to contain the word "waterproof" sorted by some combination of recency and margin — which is not a search result. It's a filtered catalog dump.

### The Revenue Cost of Zero NLP

Baymard Institute research consistently shows that 71% of ecommerce sites require exact-match wording for queries to return relevant results. Our data aligns with this: the majority of stores we analyzed fell into this category. The downstream impact is measurable. Industry research estimates that online retailers collectively lose hundreds of billions annually to failed search experiences — and NLP failure is one of the primary mechanisms behind that number.

For a store doing $5M in annual revenue, even a conservative estimate of 3–4% of sessions failing due to NLP limitations — and those sessions converting at the average assisted rate — represents $150,000–$200,000 in preventable annual revenue loss.

## Findings by Dimension: The Full Scorecard

Here's how the average store scored on each individual dimension, with a brief note on what drives each gap:

| Dimension | Average Score | Most Common Failure Mode |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **Relevance** | 51/100 | Keyword over-matching, no re-ranking |
| **NLP** | 14/100 | Legacy search with zero intent parsing |
| **Zero-Result Handling** | 22/100 | Blank dead-end pages |
| **Typo Tolerance** | 38/100 | No fuzzy matching configured |
| **Facet & Filter Quality** | 44/100 | Missing, broken, or irrelevant filters |
| **Results Diversity** | 46/100 | Over-indexed on product clusters |
| **Speed & Performance** | 63/100 | Acceptable in most cases |
| **Mobile Experience** | 41/100 | Desktop-first UIs shipped untested |

Speed and performance is the one dimension where the average store is not actively failing — a reflection of the fact that most platforms handle search response time reasonably well at the infrastructure level, even when the search itself is poor. Everything else is below 50.

## What Good Actually Looks Like

To calibrate these numbers, it helps to look at the other end of the distribution: the 4% of stores that scored an A.

A-grade stores share a consistent profile:

- **Third-party or purpose-built AI search layer** — not the platform default
- **Semantic or vector search** capable of intent parsing (NLP score: 75+)
- **Zero-result fallbacks** — at minimum a "did you mean?" suggestion, often a curated fallback category
- **Fuzzy matching enabled** — common misspellings return the same results as correct spellings
- **Facets tested on mobile** — not just desktop
- **Regular search monitoring** — teams that look at zero-result rate and top failed queries at least monthly

None of these are exotic capabilities. They are, largely, configuration decisions — choosing a search provider that supports them, and then validating that they work. The gap between an A-grade store and an F-grade store is not primarily a technology budget gap. It is a prioritization gap.

## 5 Findings Worth Citing

For journalists, bloggers, and ecommerce professionals who want to reference specific data points from this study:

1. **The average ecommerce search score is 38/100.** Most stores are failing, not underperforming.
2. **67% of stores score zero on NLP.** The majority of ecommerce search cannot understand shopper intent.
3. **62% of stores grade D or F on search quality.** Less than two-thirds of stores have search that could be described as functional.
4. **Only 4% of stores earn an A grade.** Genuinely good search is rare enough to be a competitive differentiator.
5. **WooCommerce averages 29/100 — the lowest of any major platform.** Default WordPress search is not an ecommerce search solution.

## Key Recommendations (Brief)

We'll resist the temptation to turn a data study into a best-practices listicle — for that, see the full [ecommerce site search best practices guide](/blog/ecommerce-site-search-best-practices). But the data suggests three high-priority interventions that would move the needle for most stores in the D–F range:

**1. Replace default platform search with a purpose-built layer.** The platform-to-score correlations are clear: default Shopify and WooCommerce search are not designed for product discovery. A third-party search layer that includes NLP is the highest-leverage single change available to most stores.

**2. Fix zero-result handling before anything else.** Zero-result pages that dead-end the shopper are pure revenue loss. Adding fallback suggestions, "did you mean?" prompts, or curated fallback category links takes hours to implement and has an immediate measurable impact on bounce rate from search.

**3. Test on mobile. Actually test on mobile.** Not in Chrome DevTools mobile emulation — on a real device, with real fingers. Mobile search failures are invisible in desktop audits and responsible for a disproportionate share of the mobile-specific score gaps we observed.

## Grade Your Store

The data in this study represents what hundreds of stores look like from the outside. What it cannot tell you is where your store falls on this curve — or which specific dimensions are dragging your score down.

The stores that improve their search quality share one trait: they know their actual score. Not a vague sense that "search could probably be better," but a specific number with specific dimension breakdowns pointing at specific failure modes.

The average store in our analysis scored a 38. The stores that will still be competing effectively in five years are the ones that already know that number — and are doing something about it.
